This plugin will allow WordPress users to automatically provide an audio version of their written content, using the HearWho Text to Speech engine. Upon creation of a new blog post a "Listen to this text" link will be prepended to blogs and allow the user to listen to the blog entry rather than read it. This is useful for folks trying to read-content while on the go, for visually impaired users visiting your blog, or for those that would just rather have content read to them,  rather than read it directory.  Users of this plug must obtain a free license key on https://hearwho.com to use the functionality. A free key is valid for use on conversion of up to 3,000 characters (most blog posting are usually under 3,000 characters). If you need more than this, we charge a very modest fee to substantially increase those limits (3.99 USD/month).

Instructions:

1. Install plugin through your WordPress administration page. (Or, extract the contents of the zip file and upload it directly into the plugins folder: "/wp-content/plugins/").
2. Next, activate plugin and go to the HearWho Settings page in your WordPress site and enter your API Key. (If you need an API key, create a free account on HearWho.com and visit this same page to see your key.)
3. Now, every new blog post you publish, or anytime you update an existing blog post, a high quality "spoken version" of your posting will be prepended to your posting.

Note: the plugin will not retroactively add speech versions of existing blog posts. If you would like to add an audio version for an older post, simple open up the edit screen (not quick edit) as you normally do for an older post, an simply click the update or save button.
